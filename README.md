# Student-Attendance-Management-System
A simple, file-based Student Attendance Management System written in C for the terminal. It supports two roles: Admin and Student. Admins can add/delete students, mark attendance for a date, view any studentâ€™s attendance, modify recorded attendance, and generate defaulter reports based on a threshold. Students can log in to view their personal attendance summary and detailed per-date records, and change their passwords.

Data is stored in two binary files (students.dat, attendance.dat) for persistence across runs. Attendance percentage is computed as: Present = 1.0, Late = 0.5, Absent = 0.0 credit. Input is collected via scanf with bounds checks to reduce overflows. The project is portable and builds with any C99-compatible compiler (GCC/Clang) on Linux/macOS/Windows (via MinGW or WSL). No external libraries are required.
